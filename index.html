      <p>Hi, my name is Doug. In 2013, I launched the first ever one-stop-shop for Veterans Resources in Washington
        State - RallyPoint/6. In 2015, I accepted a role as an Executive Director with an Equine Therapy Facility
        serving veterans with PTSD and autistic children. And since 2016, I've served as the Executive Director for <a
          href="https://missioncontinues.org">The
          Mission Continues</a>, a national Veteran Service Organization.</p>

      <p>I'm originally from Montreal, Canada. I moved to the U.S. when I was 19 years old. Montreal is an amazing city,
        known for its hockey, poutine, winters and incredible night life</p>

      <p>I'm also a veteran of both the Army and the Navy. I spent 4 years in the Navy as a Search
        and Rescue Swimmer, and 20 years in the Army as a Forward Observer...retiring in 2013. But it was a long time
        ago.....super proud of my time in though</p>
