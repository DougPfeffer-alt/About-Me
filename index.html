      <p>Hi, my name is **Doug**, I'm a veteran of both the Army and the Navy. I spent 4 years in the Navy as a Search and Rescue Swimmer, and 20 years in the Army as a Forward Observer...retiring in 2013. Since then, I've served with three Nonprofits. In 2013, I launched the first ever one-stop-shop for Veterans Resources in Washington State - RallyPoint/6. In 2015, I accepted a role as an Executive Director with an Equine Therapy Facility serving veterans with PTSD and autistic children. And since 2016, I've served as the Executive Director for The Mission Continues, a national Veteran Service Organization.</p>
